## Introduction

Loki is a private cryptocurrency based on Monero. Over the course of the coming months, the Loki project aims to offer an incenvised full node layer with a secondary p2p network that offers a private communications layer based on the Signal protocol.

More information on the project can be found on the website and in the whitepaper.

Loki is an open source project, and we encourage contributions from anyone with something to offer. For more information on contributing, please contact team@loki.network

## About this project

This is the GUI for the [Loki implementation](https://github.com/loki-project/loki). It is open source and completely free to use without restrictions, except for those specified in the license agreement below. There are no restrictions on anyone creating an alternative implementation of Loki that uses the protocol and network in a compatible manner.

As with many development projects, the repository on Github is considered to be the "staging" area for the latest changes. Before changes are merged into that branch on the main repository, they are tested by individual developers in their own branches, submitted as a pull request, and then subsequently tested by contributors who focus on testing and code reviews. That having been said, the repository should be carefully considered before using it in a production environment, unless there is a patch in the repository for a particular show-stopping issue you are experiencing. It is generally a better idea to use a tagged release for stability.

## Compiling the Loki GUI from source

### On Linux:

(Tested on Ubuntu 17.10 x64, Ubuntu 18.04 x64 and Gentoo x64)

1. Install Loki dependencies

  - For Debian distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Tails...)

    `sudo apt install build-essential cmake libboost-all-dev miniupnpc libunbound-dev graphviz doxygen libunwind8-dev pkg-config libssl-dev libzmq3-dev libsodium-dev libhidapi-dev`

  - For Gentoo

    `sudo emerge app-arch/xz-utils app-doc/doxygen dev-cpp/gtest dev-libs/boost dev-libs/expat dev-libs/openssl dev-util/cmake media-gfx/graphviz net-dns/unbound net-libs/ldns net-libs/miniupnpc net-libs/zeromq sys-libs/libunwind dev-libs/libsodium dev-libs/hidapi`

2. Install Qt:

  *Note*: Qt 5.7 is the minimum version required to build the GUI. This makes **some** distributions (mostly based on Debian, like Ubuntu 16.x or Linux Mint 18.x) obsolete. You can still build the GUI if you install an [official Qt release](https://wiki.qt.io/Install_Qt_5_on_Ubuntu), but this is not officially supported.

  - For Ubuntu 17.10+

    `sudo apt install qtbase5-dev qt5-default qtdeclarative5-dev qml-module-qtquick-controls qml-module-qtquick-controls2 qml-module-qtquick-dialogs qml-module-qtquick-xmllistmodel qml-module-qt-labs-settings qml-module-qt-labs-folderlistmodel qttools5-dev-tools qml-module-qtquick-templates2`

  - For Gentoo

    `sudo emerge dev-qt/qtcore:5 dev-qt/qtdeclarative:5 dev-qt/qtquickcontrols:5 dev-qt/qtquickcontrols2:5 dev-qt/qtgraphicaleffects:5`

  - Optional : To build the flag `WITH_SCANNER`

    - For Ubuntu

      `sudo apt install qtmultimedia5-dev qml-module-qtmultimedia libzbar-dev`

    - For Gentoo

      The *qml* USE flag must be enabled.

      `emerge dev-qt/qtmultimedia:5 media-gfx/zbar`


3. Clone repository

    `git clone https://github.com/loki-project/loki-gui.git`

4. Build

    ```
    cd loki-gui
    ./build.sh
    QT_SELECT=5 ./build.sh
    ```

The executable can be found in the build/release/bin folder.

### On OS X:

1. Install Xcode from AppStore

2. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

3. Install [Loki](https://github.com/loki-project/loki) dependencies:

  `brew install boost --c++11`

  `brew install openssl` - to install openssl headers

  `brew install pkgconfig`

  `brew install cmake`

  `brew install zeromq`

  `brew install hidapi`

  *Note*: If cmake can not find zmq.hpp file on OS X, installing `zmq.hpp` from https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq to `/usr/local/include` should fix that error.

4. Install Qt:

  `brew install qt5`  (or download QT 5.7.1+ from [qt.io](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/))

  If you have an older version of Qt installed via homebrew, you can force it to use 5.x like so:

  `brew link --force --overwrite qt5`

5. Add the Qt bin directory to your path

    Example: `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Qt/5.8/clang_64/bin`

    This is the directory where Qt 5.x is installed on **your** system

6. Grab an up-to-date copy of the loki-gui repository

  `git clone https://github.com/loki-project/loki-gui.git`

7. Go into the repository

  `cd loki-gui`

8. Start the build

  `./build.sh`

The executable can be found in the `build/release/bin` folder.

**Note:** Workaround for "ERROR: Xcode not set up properly"

Edit `$HOME/Qt/5.7/clang_64/mkspecs/features/mac/default_pre.prf`

replace
`isEmpty($$list($$system("/usr/bin/xcrun -find xcrun 2>/dev/null")))`

with
`isEmpty($$list($$system("/usr/bin/xcrun -find xcodebuild 2>/dev/null")))`

### On Windows:

The Loki GUI on Windows is 64 bits only; 32-bit Windows GUI builds are not officially supported anymore.

1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), follow the instructions on that page on how to update system and packages to the latest versions

2. Open an 64-bit MSYS2 shell: Use the *MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit* shortcut, or use the `msys2_shell.cmd` batch file with a `-mingw64` parameter

3. Install MSYS2 packages for Loki dependencies; the needed 64-bit packages have `x86_64` in their names

    ```
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain make mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-boost mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl mingw-w64-x86_64-zeromq mingw-w64-x86_64-libsodium mingw-w64-x86_64-hidapi
    ```

    You find more details about those dependencies in the [Loki documentation](https://github.com/loki-project/loki). Note that that there is no more need to compile Boost from source; like everything else, you can install it now with a MSYS2 package.

4. Install Qt5

    ```
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5
    ```

    There is no more need to download some special installer from the Qt website, the standard MSYS2 package for Qt will do in almost all circumstances.

5. Install git

    ```
    pacman -S git
    ```

6. Clone repository

    ```
    cd
    git clone https://github.com/loki-project/loki-gui.git
    ```

7. Build

    ```
    cd loki-gui
    ./build.sh
    source ./build.sh release-static
    cd build
    make deploy
    ```

    **Note:** The use of `source` above is a dirty workaround for a suspected bug in the current QT version 5.11.2-3 available in the MSYS2 packaging system, see https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/issues/1559 for more info.

The executable can be found in the `.\release\bin` directory.
